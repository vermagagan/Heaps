# Heap Practice Repository

Welcome to the Heap Practice Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Heap questions that I've practiced to enhance my understanding and proficiency in using Heaps.

## About Heaps

A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is either greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to (min-heap) its child nodes. Heaps are commonly used in algorithms like heapsort and for implementing priority queues.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you've solved a Heap problem that's not included here, feel free to submit a pull request with your solution implementation along with test cases.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue in the repository. I'll do my best to address it promptly.
